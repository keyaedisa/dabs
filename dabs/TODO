when rewriting abs in C, make it so that instead of each option having its own script/file
each option will be shrunk down to a list of values/attributes i.e. source git=, profile name=, etc so that
each option uses the exact same template for its values and the main abs file can plug in those values
into its own code so that instead of options being their own script its just a list of attributes

the idea is that abs iso build function only need call a file comprised of only attributes

main abs file should provide many options such as :

welcome to archiso build assistant 1.0!

choose from the following options

1) create a new custom archiso profile
2) modify an existing archiso profile


ability to modify:
profiledef.sh (and ALL of its attributes)
dev-rel
os-release
packages.x86_64
bootstrap_packages.x86_64
pacman.conf
grub directory/setup
syslinux directory/setup
efiboot directory/setup
airootfs/usr
airootfs/etc (and all its contents)
airootfs/root

ex:

options.h / options.in

xero() {

char distroName[]="XeroLinux"
char sourceGit[]="https://github.com/xerolinux/xero_iso.git"
char archisoProfileName[]="Xero"
char profileDef[]=archisoProfileName[]
.
.
.			# this is pseudo code as fuck
.

}


if ( input == "-x" ); then
	xero();

add error checking
